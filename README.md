# Ludum_Dare_46
**Repo for Ludum Dare Game Jam #46. Economic simulation/resource management video game created entirely from scratch solely by me in 48 hours.<br/>**
Resource management/economic simulation game developed in the pixel art style. The goal is to water your money trees until they get mature enough to begin producing money. You can use the money to buy water from the in-game shop. Be alert â€“ some deals are better than others; there is a dynamic pricing mechanism to the shop requiring players to think carefully before they buy. Additionally, money harvested from the trees is dynamically calculated as well. This adds for extra difficulty and no two games playing alike!!<br/>
